# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I'm looking for, I've decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. Iâ€™ll use data visualizations to share my findings.
